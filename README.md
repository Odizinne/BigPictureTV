his Python project automates switching between a monitor and a TV when launching Steam Big Picture and also handles audio output switching.

Requirements:
- Install pygetwindow via pip (`pip install pygetwindow`) to handle window titles.

Usage:
Specify your audio output settings for both desktop and gamemode variable.
   - Use the same names as they appear in Windows for the audio outputs.

If you configure this script to auto-start, you can safely shut down your PC with Steam Big Picture active, as it will reset screens and audio settings upon startup.
