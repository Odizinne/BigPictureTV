This Python project automates switching between a monitor and a TV when launching Steam Big Picture and also handles audio output switching.

Usage:<br/>
The first time you launch it, a window will show.<br/>
Specify your audio output settings for both desktop and gamemode.<br/>
Specify your Steam Big Picture window title.

If you configure this app to auto-start, you can safely shut down your PC with Steam Big Picture active, as it will reset screens and audio settings upon startup.
